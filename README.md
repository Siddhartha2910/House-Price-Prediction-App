# House Price Prediction App

An interactive **Streamlit** app for predicting house prices using **Linear Regression** based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, and proximity to a main road. The app allows users to input house details and receive real-time price predictions along with key performance metrics and visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive User Input**: Allows users to select features like area, bedrooms, main road proximity, and number of stories.
- **Model Training**: Trains a **Linear Regression** model on the given dataset for predicting house prices.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get the predicted price for a house based on the inputted features.
- **Data Visualizations**: Includes scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and model performance metrics like RÂ², MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
- **Feature Analysis**: Displays coefficients for each feature and analyzes feature importance and residuals.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web app.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Handling arrays and mathematical operations.
